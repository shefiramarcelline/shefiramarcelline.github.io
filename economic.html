                <h2>BREAKING THE CYCLE OF POVERTY
                    WITH ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT</h2>
                <p>Women face unprecedented challenges to
                    their livelihoods, their identities, their
                    institutions, and their sense of place in the
                    evolving global village.</p>

       <h2>Overview</h2>
       <br/>
       <br/>
       <p>It’s not difficult to slip into poverty or to be born poor, but it can be extremely challenging
        to escape poverty. Research suggests that many people that do escape poverty will also “fall”
        back into poverty within a short time. Limited resources can turn circumstances like illness
        or crop failure into major obstacles for communities struggling with economic
        empowerment. When families have to make impossible choices between sending their
        children to school or putting food on the table, between urgent medical care or paying to
        heat their home, between buying a source of clean water or fixing necessary farm
        equipment – everyone loses.</p>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <p>The causes of poverty are complex and can include political, social, economic and
            environmental factors that often create barriers for poor households in particular.
            Addressing these barriers to economic empowerment within a community not only
            strengthens their ability to succeed in the short-term, but also helps them become more
            resilient in the face of unexpected disasters.</p>

        <h2>Economic Empowerment of Women</h2>
        <br/><br/>
        <p>We enhance economic opportunities for women through development of knowledge and
            skills as well as linking them to business development support services. These include efforts
            towards improved confidence and self-esteem among the women and girls. Eunoia builds
            capacity of women to engage effectively with private sector engaging in extractiveswhich
            includes negotiations, planning and dialogue as well as increasing access to information.</p>
            <br/><br/>
        <h3>What we focused on</h3>
        <p>The Women Empowered (WE) Initiative is a global initiative to increase the social and
            economic empowerment of women through savings group methodologies. Eunoia
            understands that lack of financial resources is not the only cause of poverty. Economic,
            social and political factors all play a part. As such Eunoia’s WE Initiative focuses on
            economic as well as social empowerment, working to help women find their own voices
            and their power to bring about positive change. </p>
        <br/><br/>
        <p>Women join together to marshal their own financial resources, providing an
            opportunity to save for the future as well as access credit. At the same time, they gain
            experience and confidence in their ability to address issues in their homes and
            communities. WE group members practice public speaking, gain leadership skills, and
            build a sense of identity with the group, enabling them to make full use of the economic
            empowerment brought through the savings and lending. Across the globe, these groups
            have proven to be incredibly successful.</p>
            <br/><br/>
            <p>One approach under the WE Initiative is PCI’s work with the Government of Bihar in
                India. The Parivartan Project, funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, aims to
                increase the adoption of key maternal and child health and sanitation behaviors among
                women in India. The project combines savings groups with health messaging in order to
                make dual impact and empower women to plan for their future. Over 320,000 women in
                8 districts of Bihar have been impacted by this program directly through PCI, while over
                1 million women have been reached through the adoption of the approach by the
                Government of Bihar.</p>
