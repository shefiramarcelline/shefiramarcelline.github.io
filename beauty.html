                    NATURAL HAIR: 8 WOMEN’S STORIES</h2>
                <p>The empowerment itself lies in being able to make a choice</p>

       <h2>Overview</h2>
       <br/>
       <br/>
       <p  style="display:inline">When it comes to beauty and more specifically hair, black women have always been
        educators, innovators, and trendsetters. Just think about America’s first self-made
        millionaire: </p><p class="blue" style="display:inline">Madam C.J. Walker</p><p style="display:inline">, whose update to the hot comb made the tool’s popularity
        skyrocket and changed the hair of black women everywhere as a result.</p>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <p>But for all of our modernization in the hair space, there’s been almost an equal amount of
            issues, as Eurocentric beauty ideals have left little room for black women and other women
            of color with textured hair to develop the kind of self-confidence and reassurance that
            comes with ample representation.</p>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <p>Fortunately for all of us, that balance is shifting and the natural hair movement has played a
            major role in that change. The simple act of wearing our hair the way grow out of our heads
            has prompted a whole new wave of self-love in the industry this decade. And for those
            women who envelope their curls and coils in braids and weaves, as well as those who wear
            their hair straightened, relaxed and texturized, the empowerment itself lies in being able to
            making that choice.</p>

        <p>“I chopped off my hair in college, wanting to be free of my relaxed ends. The growing-out
            process felt like forever and I definitely got my share of mean comments. I remember one
            jerk called me a ‘broke Tina Turner.’ But then these little curls started emerging, these
            inquisitive little coils. Over time, I figured out what products my hair liked, what made the
            frizz go away, what made my coils feel the most healthy and nourished.</p>

        <p>“One day, a woman stopped me on the subway and asked me so many questions: What
            products do you use? Do you twist out or braid out? I was shocked that she wanted to know
            about my routin. But when that woman saw me as her natural hair inspiration, I finally
            realized that this hair is my signature. My natural hair is a visible representation of my
            personality—big, unique, and attention grabbing.”

        <p>“I fell in love with my hair when i did the big chop and saw my natural curls for the first
            time. I’d seen pictures of my natural hair as a child, but it paled in comparison to the perfect
            coils that sprung out of my scalp. I could finally see my truest self and I instantly fell in love.”

        <p>“YouTube was my savior and I started learning what worked for my hair. I can’t believe I
            lived most of my life without my curls! Now, I’m so happy with my natural hair. It actually
            grows and the curls have so much definition. Like everyone, I have bad hair days but the
            good ones are SO good, they make up for the bad.”

        <p>“As a kid in elementary school, I would always play with my own hair…I hadn’t done that in
            years. I’m playing with my hair right now. Might be why it’s so frizzy, but who cares? It’s
