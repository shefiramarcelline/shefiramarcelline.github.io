                <h2>ELIMINATION OF VIOLENCE AGAINST
                WOMEN & GIRLS</h2>
                <p>Ending violence against women and girls remains one of the most serious
                    and ongoing challenges worldwide.</p>
        </div>

   <div class="content" id="main-content">
       <h2>Overview</h2>
       <br/>
       <br/>
       <p>Violence against women and girls (VAWG) is a grave violation of human rights. Its impact
        ranges from immediate to long-term multiple physical, sexual and mental consequences for
        women and girls, including death. It negatively affects women’s general well-being and
        prevents women from fully participating in society. Violence not only has negative
        consequences for women but also their families, the community and the country at large. It
        has tremendous costs, from greater health care and legal expenses and losses in productivity,
        impacting national budgets and overall development.</p>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <p>Decades of mobilizing by civil society and women’s movements have put ending
            gender-based violence high on national and international agendas. An unprecedented
            number of countries have laws against domestic violence, sexual assault and other forms of
            violence. Challenges remain however in implementing these laws, limiting women and girls’
            access to safety and justice. Not enough is done to prevent violence, and when it does occur,
            it often goes unpunished</p>

        <p>Worldwide, women are vulnerable and at risk – enduring emotional and psychological
            trauma through harassment, terror and threats, intimidation, humiliation, degradation,
            exploitation and physical, especially sexual, injury, maiming and disability, all with chronic
            health consequences even death.</p>
        <br/><br/>
        <p>This extreme expression of male control and power over women often begins at infancy and
            may accompany a woman throughout her life to old age, through various relationships as
            daughter, sister, intimate partner, wife and mother. All forms of violence against women and
            girls occur around us on a daily basis, in our homes, families, communities, institutions,
            workplaces and in the songs, films and images of popular media.</p>

       <h2>How Eunoia Works to Elimate VAWG</h2>
       <br/><br/>
       <p>Eunoia focuses on Elimination of Violence against Women & Girls by facilitating
        development, promotion and enforcement of appropriate mechanisms for prevention,
        protection and response to violence against women. Eunoia’s prevention and response
        working groups in Nairobi, Naivasha and Mombasa has facilitated support for over 74,000
        members of the communities. We establishes multi-sectoral community VAWG working
        groups with membership from government, CBOs, FBOs, women and youth groups.</p>
        <br/><br/>
        <h3>Movement Building</h3>
        <br/><br/>
        <p>We mobilize, organise and strengthen networks, structures and mechanisms for
            prevention and effective response to VAWG at all levels. This includes establishment
            and/or strengthening of community working groups, community VAWG resource
            centers, as well as support to champions of change and community resource persons</p>
        <br/><br/>
        <h3>Awareness Raising</h3>
        <br/><br/>
        <p>We mobilize, organise and strengthen networks, structures and mechanisms for prevention
            and effective response to VAWG at all levels. This includes establishment and/or
            strengthening of community working groups, community VAWG resource centers, as well
            as support to champions of change and community resource persons. </p>
        <br/><br/>
        <p>We work with Governments to develop dedicated national action plans to prevent and
            address violence against women, strengthening coordination among diverse actors required
            for sustained and meaningful action. Strengthening community social safe guards to reduce
            the vulnerability to and effects of VAWG towards women and girls. This will include
            enhancing access to safe spaces/ shelter, psychosocial and legal support for survivors of
            VAWG. Also to initiate and establish working mechanisms for prevention and response to
            VAWG in the transport industry. </p>
