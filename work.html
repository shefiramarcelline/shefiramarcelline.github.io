       <h2>Overview</h2>
       <br/>
       <br/>
       <p>I graduated high school in 2006 when going to college was the next logical step. “If you don’t
        get your college education, you won’t find a job!”</p>
        <br><br>
        <p>So, my quest began. Financially, I had no idea what I was getting myself into. I can tell you
            with full confidence that when I fell in love with the private school I wanted to attend, and
            my parents told me tuition was upwards of $35,000 a year (not including housing), I had no
            idea what that meant. But, with my consent, my parents co-signed for a heinous chunk (a
            little over $120,000) of federal and private loans so I could go to the school I loved. I packed
            my posters, notebooks, and Ikea pillows, blissfully unaware of what lied ahead. And on I
            went to college—binding myself deeper and deeper into a financial trap</p>

        <p>The United States has a collective 1.5 trillion dollars in student loan debt, the second largest
            category of consumer debt in the US, eclipsing everything else except mortgages. Women
            hold most of this debt. On average, this exceeds credit card payments, auto loan payments,
            and continues to be a ballooning sector of debt across the entire nation</p>
        <br><br>
        <h2>What would happen if *poof* all of the student
                debt in the US went away?</h2>
        <br><br>
        <p>A team of economists, Scott Fullwiler, Catherine Ruetschlin, Marshall Steinbaum, and Dr.
            Stephanie Kelton—professor of Public Policy and Economics at Stony Brook
            University—did some research to answer this question last year. Their findings within “The
            Macroeconomic Effects of Student Debt Cancellation” covered what would happen
            economically if the federal government cancelled the 1.5 trillion (1.41 trillion at the time of
            the report) of student loan debt.</p>
        <br><br>
        <p>Theoretically, this would look like a one-time policy where the federal government would
            cancel the loans it holds directly and take over financing of privately owned loans. Of
            course, if people are relieved of their debt this way, they would do other things with the
            money: Buy consumer goods and services and become customers for businesses. Businesses,
            in turn, will need to hire more and small businesses will flourish. When people have the
            money to spend, they stimulate the economy, more jobs grow, and nothing bad happens. </p>
        <br><br>
        <h3>The term “federal deficit” has been yielded as a political tool</h3>
        <br><br>
        <p>The federal government does not need to collect money from the rest of us to
            spend money. So, if someone wanted to come along and void student loan debt,
            they could do that.</p>
        <br><br>
        <p>In their research, this group of economists said that if we cancel the $1.3 trillion in
            student loan debt, a few positive spillover effects would happen. For one, 1.2 to 1.5
            million new jobs appear that wouldn’t have been there otherwise. In real GDP
            terms, that would create another trillion dollars over ten years. Also, there would
            be no significant increase in deficit or inflation relative to the GDP.</p>

        <h3>The successful mid-term candidates that support loan reform or
            have a solid position on the subject</h3>
        <br><br>
        <p style="display: inline;">There are certainly ways to avoid the type of student debt burden that I’m going through.
            My advice? </p><p style="display: inline;" class="blue"> your degree at an inexpensive community college</p><p style="display: inline;">, or seek federal grants
            (instead of private loans), or supplement your learning with online courses instead of
            dropping $150-180K on an elite four-year degree (plus grad school after that), to list a few</p>
        <br><br>
        <p>No matter what, the debt we take on to get an education hangs a dark cloud over many of
            us, no matter the route taken. Millennials are being buried in financial situations they didn’t
            expect to deal with throughout their entire lives. It’s time to create ambitious policies. It’s
            time to start talking about what student loan reform means for our economy and how we
            can help the people younger than ourselves. </p>
        <br><br>
        <p>If student loan reform is near and dear to your heart, vote. Stay politically active and stay
            loud. Change is always possible, you just need to demand it.</p>
